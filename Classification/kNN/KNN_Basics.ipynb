    "### What is KNN?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN is technique which is used for Classification Problems for example Amazon Reviews to classify whether a review is positive or negative.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Its done by Training a function f(x) i.e we will train this function from the given dataset and after that if we give any queryPoint to this function it will return whether its positive or negative review.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### How KNN is calculated?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we pass a querypoint(the point which need to be classified) to y=f(x), It will calculate 'K nearest Neighbours' to the querypoint so that we will get k yi's(i.e positive or negative) and if majority of Yi's are positive the Querypoint is considered as positive review or else negative review.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where KNN Fails?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN fails in 2 cases:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 1: When the query point is far away from both the positive and negative points(i.e its an outlier), then its hard to classify.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 2: When Data Points are randomly spread the its hard to classify if the querypoint is positive or negative review.<br>"
